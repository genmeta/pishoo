Pishoo takes its name from Pixiu (貔貅), an auspicious creature in ancient Chinese mythology. The name reflects its role in protecting local data, securing the network boundary, and controlling external access. Like Nginx in the conventional HTTP stack, Pishoo provides web serving, reverse proxying, load balancing, and support for NAT traversal in the DHttp stack. The key difference is how services are exposed. A conventional Nginx deployment typically exposes a service through a fixed listening port on a publicly reachable address. With DHttp, the service itself does not need a fixed public IP address or port, allowing Pishoo to be deployed on any endpoint.

## Why Pishoo?

**Gateways Protect Data Assets:** Why does your private data often seem more exposed than the data held by large platforms? One reason is that large platforms place gateways in front of their services. Like a gate that protects private territory, a gateway helps control what a service exposes and who can access it. Put Pishoo in front of the data and services you run yourself to retain that control.

- **Personal Server:** Cloud servers are not your only option. With Pishoo, you are free to choose any device as your personal server.
- **Agent Home:** The best way to access your AI agent is directly in your browser, not through a chat app. To make that possible, run your agent behind Pishoo.

## How it works

- **DHttp Inside:** Pishoo is a DHttp-native gateway that lets any endpoint expose services without requiring a public IP address or a fixed listening port.
- **APIs Everywhere:** The agentic internet is driving a new wave of API openness, in which every agent ultimately has its own open API.
- **Access Control:** Open APIs do not mean unrestricted access. Pishoo grants API access to authorized names rather than requiring a traditional login.

## Getting started

The current development branch is implementing the [v1 contract](design/README.md).
Its SQLite configuration, completed work, test commands, and remaining
transport/exec work are recorded in [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md).
The packaged-release installation instructions below describe the earlier release.

### Install Pishoo

Pishoo supports mainstream Linux distributions and macOS on both Arm and x86 architectures. For a quick deployment, we recommend installing the `gmutils` operations toolkit alongside Pishoo.

#### Linux (Debian 11+)

```sh
wget -qO- https://download.dhttp.net/ppa/key/public.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/genmeta.gpg > /dev/null

sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/genmeta.sources > /dev/null <<'EOF'
Types: deb
URIs: https://download.dhttp.net/ppa/genmeta
Suites: stable preview
Components: main
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/genmeta.gpg
EOF

sudo apt update
sudo apt install pishoo gmutils
```

#### macOS

```sh
brew tap genmeta/preview https://github.com/genmeta/homebrew-preview
brew trust genmeta/preview
brew update
brew install pishoo gmutils
```

### Create an identity

You can purchase a name and certificate, then place them in the appropriate location. However, we recommend using `gmutils` to install them automatically.

```sh
genmeta identity apply
```

### Current development configuration

Set `DHTTP_HOME` before starting Pishoo. Each Server reads its own `<DHTTP_HOME>/<identity>/db/config.db`; there is no instance configuration file or database. Schema v1 has one `settings(listen, ssh)` row and a `proxy_locations(location, proxy_pass)` table. `ssh=1` enables `POST /exec` for the same verified identity; it runs one host command with the Pishoo service account's permissions. See [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) for the SQL schema and current behavior.

### Run

Start the development build with `DHTTP_HOME` pointing to the instance directory. Changes to `listen` or `ssh` require a restart; proxy routes and Libs reload during the running process.

### Access

You can access Pishoo with [`genmeta-curl`](https://docs.dhttp.net/docs/core-components/utils/cli-curl), [DHttp SDK](https://docs.dhttp.net/docs/core-components/sdk), or [AnySee browser](https://docs.dhttp.net/zh/docs/core-components/anysee).

```bash
genmeta curl https://your.name~/welcome
```

For directive reference and additional reverse-proxy examples, see the official [Pishoo documentation](https://docs.dhttp.net/en/docs/core-components/pishoo).
